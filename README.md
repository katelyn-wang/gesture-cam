4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    We did not consult with any other people as part of this assignment.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    No


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
    
    We did not design the app for a particular user -- just generally for anyone who would
    benefit from or enjoy using a gesture controlled camera.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
    
    We created a Left Point and a Right Point gesture. A left point is when the point is on the 
    left side of the screen (mean x-position of the box is less than the midpoint) 
    and a right point is when a point is on the right side of the screen.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
    
    We have clear instructions/controls listed on each page with icons to visualize, 
    and the gestures make sense with what actions they do (like point right to go to the next
    picture in the carousel). We also implemented the download and delete picture gestures to 
    have to be held for two seconds in order to work so that it is less likely to accidentally 
    do one of those actions without intending to.
